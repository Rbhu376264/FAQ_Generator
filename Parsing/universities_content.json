            "Tell us about an exciting and unforgettable experience from your time so far at USC.\nI did my Bachelor\u2019s degree at the American University in Bulgaria \u2013a small university where anyone quickly gets to know everyone. USC on the other hand is a huge university for the standards of where I come from. It has the same population as my entire hometown. I didn\u2019t know anyone, and I didn\u2019t know much about the area of the university. I had to be proactive to go around and learn about my surroundings and meet people. Kind of like a quest to explore the unknown land. It had its challenges, especially with COVID measures being enforced. But it was so much fun and exciting. I still look back at my first few weeks with a smile on my face. I went to all of the new student welcoming events and met so many bright and inspiring people who have a wide variety of interests and skills. I highly encourage new students to do something similar. Meeting people and participating in events and activities is how unforgettable memories are made and how opportunities open up.",
            "What are some personal achievements or experiences you\u2019d like to share?\nI think I managed to meet people from all the continents now, and from so many countries. I think learning about other cultures is such an eye-opening experience in many aspects. You start to understand other people more, but you also learn more about yourself. I especially encourage internationals and people like me who come from smaller towns to explore cultural events. After all, you don\u2019t get such chances every day. Check out an on-campus event, go to a concert, or a sports game, travel around Los Angeles. You might be surprised how much you will grow from that as a person.",
            "Which organizations/activities have you been involved with outside of the classroom?\nI am part of the Fulbright community in LA, the USC Star Wars club, and Remedy Through Music which is a volunteering club for musicians. I have also applied to be a mentor in Fall 2022.\n.",

            "What do you like most about living in Los Angeles?\nI love riding motorcycle in Los Angeles. World famous San Gabriel Canyons arewithin 30 minutes ride from town. The weather is always sunny and temperature is never too low in winter. With legal lane splitting in California, It is a paradise for riders.",
            "What advice would you give future Viterbi students?\nLook at the curriculum first and see if the school offers courses to your interest before you make a decision. Don't buy a car if you live near the campus. You will not drive it often. Begin preparing for job interviews as early as possible.\n.",
            "What are some personal achievements or experiences you\u2019d like to share? \nGetting an internship in one of the best companies in the world -Microsoft along with three other best offers, shocked me of my own abilities. ",

Very few international MS applicants will be admitted to our MS program. \n\n\n\nThe application for admission, application fee, and all the required\nsupporting documents should be received at least two months prior to\nyour desired semester of enrollment (see the deadlines below). \n\n\nAll\noutstanding applicants are automatically considered for graduate\nassistantships (teaching and research) and fellowships.\n\nInstitution and Program Codes\n\nGRE and TOEFL Codes\n\t\nGRE and TOEFL Institution Code for Michigan State University -- 1465\nGRE Department and Major Field Code for Computer Science -- 0402 \nTOEFL Department Code for Computer Science -- 78\n\n\nMichigan State University Internal Program Codes\n\t\nMichigan State University Code for MS program in Computer Science -- 2335\nMichigan State University Code for PhD program in Computer Science -- 2336\n\n\n\nApplicants with Fellowships/Scholarships\n\nIf you have an external fellowship or scholarship of some kind, please email graddir@cse.msu.edu with information about your fellowship/scholarship including\n\n\nThe name of the fellowship or scholarship (e.g. Fulbright).\nThe dates the fellowship or scholarship will cover (e.g. August 2016-August 2019).\nThe amount of support provided by the fellowship or scholarship (e.g. Tuition and fees or $20,000/year).\n\nThree Step Application Process\n\nThere are three main steps you must follow to complete your application.\n\n\nComplete the \n\tOnline MSU Application for Graduate Studies.\n\tYou will be required to pay an application fee. \n\tWhile completing this application, please note the following.\n\t\n\nText boxes will be provided for you to fill out two statements, an academic statement and a personal statement.\n\n\n\nDo not enter your full statements in the text boxes in the MSU graduate application. \nInstead, type in these text boxes that ``Full statement will be uploaded using the graduate student portal.''\n\n \nHowever, please do answer the supplemental questions at the end of the application even though your statements may include responses to these questions. \nResponses to these questions are used by the admissions committee to help identify strong applicants to nominate for university and college fellowships.\nAnswering these questions will increase the chances that your application is considered for these fellowships.\n\n \nSave your MSU applicant ID and password as you will need this to complete the second step of the application process.\n\n\nUpload/enter additional application materials/information using the \ngraduate student education portal which you access with your MSU applicant ID and password.\n\n\n\nEnter information for references who will then be asked to submit letters of recommendation. \n\n\nYou need 3 references.\nIdeally, at least two references should be college faculty who know you well.\n You can complete this step prior to submitting your MSU graduate application. You are strongly encouraged to do so to give your references more time to complete their letters.\n\n Upload your full academic and personal statements.\nPlease follow the guidelines below when completing your statements.\n\n\n Academic Statement\n Personal Statement\n\n Transcripts and Degree Certificates\n\n \nUnofficial transcript for review\n\n For review purposes only, you must upload an unofficial transcript of all college work (undergraduate and graduate) in the graduate student portal. \n\nFor this uploaded unofficial transcript, do NOT upload a secure transcript. \n\nThis complicates review of your application as our program will not be able to automatically concatenate all the uploaded files into a convenient PDF.\nJust upload an unofficial transcript in regular PDF format with no security features.\n Please ensure that you include the back side of one transcript page (this back side often includes critical rating/scale information); no need for more than one back side page.\n\n Official transcript(s) and degree certificate(s) for admission\n\n We also will need official transcripts for admission. The documents needed depend on the following scenarios:\n\n You will have received a Bachelor's degree (or Masters degree) prior to April 15 for Fall applications or August 15 for Spring applications.\n\n In this case, you must arrange for delivery of official transcripts and proof that you have received your degree before you can be admitted to our graduate programs. This proof might be your official transcript if it includes language that your degree has been conferred. For international students especially, this proof often is in the form of a certificate. You must submit both an English language certificate plus an original language certificate. These documents must be sent directly from your institution to MSU.\n\n You will NOT have received a Bachelor's degree prior to April 15 for Fall applications or August 15 for Spring applications.\n\n In this case, you must arrange for delivery of official transcript(s) directly from the institution(s) to MSU.\n\n\n All official documents must be sent directly from each university in a sealed envelope. \nThese documents should be sent to the following address: \n\n\n\nOffice of Admissions\nMichigan State University\nHannah Administration Building\n426 Auditorium Road, Room 250\nEast Lansing, MI 48824\nU.S.A.\n\n\n If you are applying for admission in fall semester and will graduate in December, please submit the unofficial transcript online as early as possible but wait to submit your official transcript and certificate until it reflects that you have graduated as MSU will require these documents before processing your admission and giving you an I-20 if you are an international applicant.\n\nFor applicants with degrees from Chinese universities, please follow the above process. In particular, during the application process, MSU does NOT require CDGDC verification of transcripts.\n\n If you are admitted to the computer science MS or PhD program, MSU will eventually require CDGDC verification of your final bachelor degree transcript and bachelor degree. \nNote that CDGDC verification of MS degrees or transcripts is never required.\n\nCSE will REIMBURSE you for the cost of CDGDC verification once you \narrive and are officially an MSU student. We will work with you to make this verification process as easy as possible.\n\n",

            "Applicants must have completed a bachelor's degree or the equivalent before beginning graduate study. Applicants who already hold a Ph.D. degree will not be considered for a second Ph.D. degree. Transcripts from each college or university attended, three letters of recommendation, a CV, and the applicant's statement of purpose are required components of the application and are carefully and equally weighed during the evaluation process. GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and in most options scores will not be considered for admission. Most of the funding sources require work authorization. As a consequence, matriculation into the PhD program requires evidence of work authorization, unless special compensation can be arranged with the admitting option. Applicants are expected to read, write and speak English and comprehend the spoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose native language is not English or who have not received a degree from a university or college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is important to demonstrate a strong capability in English. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language proficiency examination."

            "No, the department admits students based on broad research interests and provides general departmental funding for the first two years. A faculty member may contact you as part of the admissions process, and you may choose to initiate a discussion about your research with a faculty member with similar interests.

            "However, we do suggest you evaluate your own likelihood of being admitted to Duke. Take a look at the statistics regarding the last admission season; you will see that Duke is very competitive, that is, we receive many applications and admit only a small percentage. You can look at the courses under the Education tab to determine whether you have the background to do well; the graduate level courses are 500 and above and many of the courses have a website (you might have to look at a previous semester for the website).",
            "Consideration of an applicant occurs only after official submission of the application. You may look at the\u00a0statistics for the department\u00a0regarding the number of applicants in a given year, and the number of admitted students and make an educated decision.",

            "Yes. There may be advantages to having already earned a Master's degree because you may have experience in research and with graduate level courses. However, all PhD students enter the program with the same requirements, Master's or not.",
            "For a Master's candidate, there is a mechanism in place for transferring up to two courses after the completion of 12 hours at Duke. Approval must be made at the level of the department and the Graduate School, and is in no way guaranteed.",
            "For a PhD student, there are exceptional cases in which a course from another school would be accepted toward the PhD course requirements. This decision would be made only in the 2nd year after completion of some coursework at Duke and never as part of the admission.",

            "On October 8, 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 620, which includes a request that UC provide the opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to report their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression on any forms used to collect demographic data.\u00a0\n\nIn 2012, then UC President Mark Yudof created and charged the Task Force & Implementation Team on LGBT Climate and Inclusion (LGBT Task Force) with developing priorities, strategies, and expected resource requirements to advance recommendations submitted by the LGBT Working Group of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Campus Climate and Inclusion. On May 30, 2014, the LGBT Task Force presented a report to UC President Janet Napolitano with a recommendation to implement AB 620.\u00a0\n\nIn September 2014, UC President Janet Napolitano formed the President\u2019s Advisory Council on LGBT Students, Faculty, and Staff, which is comprised of faculty, LGBT Center staff, students, and community experts. They were charged with making the UC system a gold standard for LGBT issues, and to provide recommendations for the implementation of AB 620 by collecting data on gender identity and sexual orientation through the admission application.\u00a0\n\nProviding the LGBT community with the option to self-identify supports the University\u2019s priorities of creating an inclusive and welcoming campus environment across the UC system. Including these questions on the graduate application will signal to applicants that UC is an inclusive environment and that the LGBT community is part of it. As with all other demographic questions on the admission application, providing gender identity and sexual orientation data will be voluntary, optional, and as required by law, not impact admission decisions.",

            "The University of California's nondiscrimination policy includes protections for sex and gender identities. A key element of creating a safe space for people of all sexes and gender identities is the respectful use of pronouns. Asking UCSB community members what their pronouns are and consistently using them correctly is one of the most basic ways to show respect. To learn more about pronouns and why they are important, please visit the\u00a0UC Santa Barbara Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) web site.",

The Center of Excellence for Transgender Health and UC San Francisco began advocating the use of the two-step protocol in 2007, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted it in 2011. The two-step method was also cognitively tested by two research teams as part of the Williams Institute\u2019s research on best practices to identify transgender people and other gender minorities through population-based surveys.",

The question has been thoroughly tested and is currently in use in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), and other state-level surveys. In keeping with approaches employed by NHIS and CHIS, respondents are provided a space to self-identify if the available answer options do not suit them.",

These data will also enable campuses to develop curricular and co-curricular offerings that reflect students\u2019 diverse perspectives, and that promote a safe and welcoming learning environment for all students.\n\nAs a recipient of federal Title IV financial aid funds, UC Santa Barbara is required to gather and report demographic data for undergraduate and graduate students, including gender data. For federal reporting purposes (i.e., IPEDS), it is recommended that Trans Female/Trans Woman be reported as Women, and Trans Male/Trans Man be reported as men. In addition, genderqueer and gender non-conforming individuals should be reported as their sex assigned at birth.\u00a0 Data collected should be included on the student record, unless the student opts for \u201conly aggregate\u201d reporting. If a student opts for exclusion from their personal record, these data should be maintained in aggregate form at the campus and student classification levels.\u00a0 Students will be provided with an avenue to update or change their gender identity or sexual orientation data through online campus student portals or an alternate method determined by the campus.",

Some students succeed in getting an advisor before they start the program, and some students get ignored. While the outcome depends in part on what you have to offer as a graduate student, a lot is also a matter of how you go about approaching potential advisors. In particular, an initial contact email needs to clearly explain what you are asking for, and most importantly it needs to explain why you are contacting that particular faculty member. This means that you need to do your homework, and be able to tell the person you are contacting why their research in particular is of interest to you, and how your experience or interests make you a good candidate for their group. Anything that looks like a form letter is likely to be ignored. It is generally a bad idea to lead with needing support. If you do, the person you are contacting might think that you only care about the support, not them or the research area. If you are accepted into the group, then often support will come in time.",

Virginia Tech (and most universities in the US) follow a different approach. You could be admitted to the Ph.D. program straight out of your B.S. - it really depends on what your degree objective is.",
            "That said, we have designed the requirements for a Ph.D. in CS to be a superset of the M.S. (coursework) requirements. So you have the option (but not the obligation) of obtaining a Virginia Tech M.S. \"on the way\" as you complete the coursework requirement of your Ph.D. degree (irrespective of whether you entered with/without an M.S. degree from elsewhere).

What if I change my degree emphasis from HCI to scientific computing? What if I shift from thesis to non-thesis? From M.S. to Ph.D.? What if I change my committee? What if I change my advisor?",
            "Yes and no: it is binding but you can easily change it. Once a POS is filed, it can be changed numerous times, as needed. This is normal to change the POS during the course of your studies (and changes are far easier to process than the original submission). For change of degree or thesis/non-thesis option, you will need to change your degree program first. See FAQ under \"Degree Programs\". Then file a new POS.",

            "This seems quite complicated. Why can't I just submit a fresh POS and be done with it?",

All such credits must have earned grades of \"B\" or better, have been earned while in good standing in graduate status, and must have been graduate courses (numbered 5000 or higher) at the institution where the student took the courses. Grades of \"S\" or \"P\" are not acceptable for transfer credit. All transfer courses must be acceptable to the student\u2019s Advisory Committee and the Graduate Program Director or Department Head. For transfer course work more than five years old, a Justification of 'Old' Course Work form must be filed with the Plan of Study.",
            "So, Masters thesis students can transfer up to 3 courses and Ph.D. students can transfer up to 4 courses (or 5 if you count 10 courses on your plan of study), but in all cases only such courses that were taken while in a graduate program.",

            "You can transfer courses as 4000-, 5000-, or 6000-level CS courses. You can also transfer them as other department (cognate) courses. All of these can potentially be used toward your graduate Plan of Study here.",
            "\u00a0",
            "How do I proceed with the paperwork?",
            "For each course that you want to transfer, fill out a credit transfer form, available from the Forms page. Identify a faculty member who is most suited to evaluate the equivalence of the course (this can be either someone who is currently teaching or has previously taught a similar course here before and/or someone whose research interests are closest to the area). Go to them with as much background info as possible. Just showing your transcript is not sufficient for somebody to judge equivalency. Bring materials such as course syllabus, sample homeworks, course web site, or similar information so that they can make a recommendation.",

            "And how does transfers for outside-CS (cognate) courses work?",

            "\u00a0",
            "Do you have a list of outside-CS professors that I can contact?",

            "I do not have any materials from my previous course. What should I do in order to get it transferred?",

            "\u00a0",
            "Ok. The professor has approved the transfer. What do I do now?",
            "For now, nothing. Just keep these approval forms handy with the professor's signature and submit them when you turn in your complete plan of study. At that point, the ADH-GS will approve them along with the rest of your plan of study.",

            "Is there a deadline to have courses transferred?",
            "No, but it advisable to get them done as quickly as possible. Definitely before your Plan of Study is to be filed (so that you can hand the forms in with the POS).",
